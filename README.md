# Telegram-Bot
 
## Motivation
I build this during the COVID-19 pandemic as I wanted to explore the basics of another programming language. I have also been using bots a lot in telegram and wanted to emulate and test out creating a simple telegram bot that gives foreigners a little more understanding about the Singaporean language and food :)

However, this bot is inactive at the moment unless i activate it on my terminal as it is a small scale trial. I have attached a screenshot to see how it works though!

## Language used :
Ruby
